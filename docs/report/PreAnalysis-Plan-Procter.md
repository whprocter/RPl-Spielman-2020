I will be adding to Holler's and Smith's mostly-complete study of Spielman et al.'s 2020 Evaluation of the Social Vulnerability Index

I set out to accomplish the following amendments/improvements to the study and its methodology:

1) I plan to create a national-level interactive SoVI map so that readers of this report can view the spatial distribution of vulnerability across the united states.  While Spielman mentions that they do this in the paper, there is no national-level map presented.  This interactive map could be useful from a policy perspective in terms of identifying counties with high social vulnerability to direct aid and other resources.

2) Next, I plan to create an output table of PCA factor loadings (ie. weights) for the national SoVI index.  This shows which variables are being weighted high/lower in creating the principal components.

3) I also plan to calculate and output the percent variance explained by each component of the national SoVI.  Because we employed PCA as a dimensionality reduction technique, knowing the percent variance explained by each component informs us of which principal components are most worthwhile using in later models.

4) Lastly, I plan to reweighted the SoVI by the percentage variance explained of each component, rather than using a simple sum of the components.  Then, I will compare my results with the weighting to the results without the weighting in Figure 1 and Table 2, and then discuss my findings and their implications for the study.
